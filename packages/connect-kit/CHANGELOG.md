## 1.0.7 - 2022-12-13
### Changed
- Close the ConnectWithLedgerLive modal when clicking outside.
- Make the cursor a pointer for the "Install" link on the
  ConnectWithLedgerLive modal.
- Fix spacing around the "or" line on the ConnectWithLedgerLive modal

## 1.0.6 - 2022-12-13
### Changed
- Redesign the ConnectWithLedgerLive to be visually simpler.
- Add back a call to hide the ConnectWithLedgerLive modal to the
  WalletConnect connect event handler since it is still needed when scanning
  the QR code.

## 1.0.5 - 2022-12-12
### Changed
- Return a valid provider in case the Connect extension is supported but not
  enabled, instead of throwing an exception. The modal that guides the user to
  install the extension was being shown on the `getProvider` function, but has
  been moved to the `eth_requestAccounts` request on the new provider to
  correctly work with autoconnect on wagmi.

## 1.0.4 - 2022-12-06
### Changed
- Create a new WalletConnect session each time `eth_requestAccounts` is called
  (and hence each time the "Use Ledger Live" modal is shown) to avoid reusing
  the same WalletConnect URI.
- The "Use Ledger Live" modal is now closed when pressing the "Use Ledger
  Live" button to avoid the same WalletConnect URI being reused (e.g. if the
  user clicks "Decline" in Ledger Live and clicks "Use Ledger Live" again.
- No longer reuse the provider instance in the Provider module as it
  interferes with refreshing the WalletConnect URI.
- No longer reuse the provider instance in the WalletConnect module.

## 1.0.3 - 2022-12-06

## 1.0.2 - 2022-12-02
### Changed
- Use the ledgerlive: deeplink for the QR code instead of the WalletConnect
  URI; this allows scanning the QR code with the native camera app.

## 1.0.1 - 2022-12-02
### Changed
- Don't open a blank tab when pressing the User Ledger Live deeplink.
- Correctly detect the Brave browser on iOS.
- Patch the provider's request method to handle the Connect With Ledger Live
  modal in the `eth_requestAccounts` method, allowing us to reject with the
  "user rejected connection" error when the modal is closed.

## 1.0.0 - 2022-11-17
### Changed
- Promoted to 1.0.

## 1.0.0-beta.4-5 - 2022-11-01

## 1.0.0-beta.8 - 2022-11-15

  WalletConnect.

## 1.0.0-beta.7 - 2022-11-14
### Changed
